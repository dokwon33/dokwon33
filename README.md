AI-Driven Radio Access Network · Network Intelligence · Wireless Systems

I’m exploring how AI can transform the Radio Access Network — from scheduling and beamforming to full-stack network optimization.
My research sits at the intersection of deep learning, wireless communication, and large-scale system implementation.

### 🚀 Research Focus
📡 Radio Access Network (RAN)

1. Intelligent gNB scheduling & resource allocation

2. AI-driven HARQ prediction & link adaptation

3. Channel estimation & CSI compression with deep learning

4. Multi-cell coordination & interference management

🤖 AI for Wireless Systems

1. Reinforcement learning for dynamic RAN control

2. Graph neural networks for cell/UE topology modeling

3. Foundation models for wireless signal processing

🛰 System Engineering

1. O-RAN architecture research

2. Near-RT RIC intelligent control loops

3. Real-world dataset generation & RF environment simulation
